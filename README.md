# Kiri AI - A Smart Voice Assistant Application
Welcome to the Kiri AI repository! This project showcases a voice assistant application designed for both Android and iOS platforms, developed using Dart and Flutter technologies.

### Overview
In this project, I aimed to create a sophisticated voice assistant application that seamlessly integrates advanced speech recognition capabilities with Restful API. The application allows users to interact with their devices intuitively through voice commands, offering a streamlined and efficient user experience.

### Key Features
- Advanced Speech Recognition: The application leverages cutting-edge speech recognition technology to accurately interpret user commands and perform corresponding actions.
- Integration with Open AI APIs: To enhance user experience and engagement, I integrated Open AI APIs to enable dynamic and intelligent responses tailored to user queries. This feature enriches the interaction, providing users with personalized and relevant feedback.
- Image Generation Functionalities: The incorporation of image generation functionalities from Open AI adds visual elements to the user experience, offering visually stimulating feedback and enhancing overall engagement.

### Technologies Used
- Dart: Dart is a powerful programming language optimized for building user interfaces with Flutter.
- Flutter: Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Open AI APIs: Open AI APIs are utilized to enable intelligent responses and image generation functionalities, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Voice Assistant Application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Flutter and Dart SDKs if you haven't already.
3. Run the application on your preferred emulator or physical device.
4. Explore the intuitive voice commands and experience the seamless interaction firsthand!

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-Language Support: Implement support for multiple languages to cater to a wider user base.
